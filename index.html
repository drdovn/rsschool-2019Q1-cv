My name is Elena Dovnar.<br>
Because of the current situation in the world and the all-consuming development of technology,
and especially the introduction of information technology in all spheres of life, I believe in the need for serious study of programming.
I think soon there will be no work that does not require interaction with the network or other technical devices.
That was one of the reasons.<br>
On the other hand, having, to some extent, a mathematical mindset and since childhood “learned to learn”,
I like to solve interesting problems considering different options or approaches.<br>
Another factor why I am attracted to this area is the youth-adult staff,
not mired in the depths of office gossip and intrigue. The opportunity to work on the project with really different people,
but to know that it is not forever allows you to appreciate the time spent with them, adopting their experience and becoming better.<br>
In conclusion, I would like to say that I appreciate the opportunities offered by RSS,
I think if I manage to pass all the stages, I will become a good worker.

    <h3>Skills & Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>C++ : 2 years in the University</li>
      <li>MySQL : 1 semester</li>
      <li>SQL : 1 semester</li>
    </ul>
      <p>
        I’m still studying, that is why i have no expressive experience. Therefore,
        I think the most important my results will be shown at these courses.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I’m a student of Belarusian state University of Economics, 2nd course.<br>
I haven’t passed any courses connected with programming or mathematics. But there were additional language classes.</p>

  <div class="english" id="english">
    <h3>English level</h3>
    <p>As I already told I attended additional classes on English and some time even the tutor.
       As a result, I had a B2 level and received a certificate of 90 points for CT. Now I do not know my level of English,
         but I think if necessary I can pull it up in a not very long time. </p>
